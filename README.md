# LangChain_models
### The Model Component in LangChain is a crucial part of the framework, designed to falicitate interactions with variious language models and embedding models.
### It abstracts the complexity of working directly with different LLMs, chat models, and embedding models, providing a uniform interface to communicate with them. This makes it easier to build applications that rely on AI-generated text, text embeddings for similarity search and RAG.
## Types of Models:
### (1) Language Models
### (2) LLMs
### (3) Chat Models
